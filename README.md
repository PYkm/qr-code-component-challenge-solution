## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add shadow to a element using box-shadow property:

```css
.qr_code_container{
  box-shadow: 0 2em 2em hsla(218, 44%, 22%, .05);
}
```

### Continued development

Concept that I'm not completely familiar with, used in this challenge:
- CSS Custom properties

Technique that I found useful, although not using in this challenge:
- SASS

### Useful resources
